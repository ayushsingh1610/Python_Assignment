Write a function that returns the maximum of two numbers.
Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.
    I. If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
    II. If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
    III. If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
    IV. Otherwise, it should return the same number.

Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have
one parameter: speed.
I. If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
II. Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give
the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit
points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
III. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print:
“License suspended”

Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It
should print all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the
even and odd numbers. For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:
1. 0 EVEN
2. 1 ODD
3. 2 EVEN
4. 3 ODD
